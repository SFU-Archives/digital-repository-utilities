# Digital Repository Utilities

This site lists the various software tools, scripts and utilities SFU Archives uses in its digital repository work. Its purpose is to facilitate public sharing with institutions that may be interested in adpating or using the tools.

Each entry links to a minimal description, with additional links to downloadable files or documentation where applicable. To minimize duplication, the Archives manages its full documentation on a single internal SharePoint site. Pages suitable for public sharing are output as pdf and posted here; pages may be redacted to remove server names and file paths.
