# Digital Repository Utilities

This site lists the various software tools, scripts and utilities SFU Archives uses in its digital repository work. Its purpose is to facilitate public sharing with institutions that may be interested in adpating or using the tools.

For each utility, there is a minimal description, with links to downloadable files or documentation where applicable. To minimize duplications, the Archives manages its full documentation on a single internal SharePoint site. Pages suitable for public sharing are output as pdf and posted here; pages may be redacted to remove server names and file paths.

***Access-to-Memory (AtoM)***
- Online access platform (descriptions and digital objects) shared by SFU Archives and SFU Special Collections and Rare Books.
- [Site](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca)

***Archives Information System (AIS) Database***
