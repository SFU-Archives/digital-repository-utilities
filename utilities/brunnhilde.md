# Brunnhilde

**Brunnhilde** is an open-source utility for analysis and file characterization of disk images and file directories. The app was developed and is maintained by [Tessa Walsh](https://github.com/tw4l). The app can be run in a GUI or via command line.

The Archives prefers the command line version, as it simpler to run than the GUI, which use a deprecated element (`basename`) and requires the user to edit settings on different tabs.

SFU Archives uses Brunnhilde in both its digital transfer and archival processing workflows. It is used to analyze transfer packages prior to ingest and support validation and accessioning; and in archival arrangement and description the archivist can use Brunnhilde to better understand the contents of an accrual, identify duplicates, support appraisal, and document file formats.
