**Access-to-Memory (AtoM)** is a "web-based, open source application for standards-based archival description and access in a multilingual, multi-repository environment" ([AtoM website](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/)). It was created and is maintained by [Artefactual Systems, Inc.](https://www.artefactual.com)

SFU Archives has used AtoM since 2014 as its primary platform for archival description and for public dissemination of digital access copies of holdings. The site is shared (as [SFU AtoM](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca)) with SFU Special Collections and Rare Books, a division of SFU Library. SFU AtoM is currently (as of Nov 2023) running AtoM version 2.6.4, with plans to upgrade to the most recent 2.7 version (with a customized SFU theme) at the end of 2023 / early 2024.

## Installation
SFU AtoM is hosted locally by SFU IT Services on servers in [SFU Cloud](https://www.sfu.ca/information-systems/services/sfu-cloud.html). Installation, upgrades and maintenance are managed by Artefactual under an annual services agreement.

## Configuration
The Archives runs AtoM on an internal production site and a public read-only site, which are synced weekly. Technical specifications and configurations are managed by Artefactual and SFU ITS. The site uses the AtoM's Rules for Archival Description (RAD) template for data entry and presentation.

## Usage
User guidelines for data entry are provided on the Archives' [SFU AtoM Guidelines and Processing Resources](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/atom-guidelines-processing-resources) GitHub repository.
