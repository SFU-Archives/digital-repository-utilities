# Access-to-Memory (AtoM)

**Access-to-Memory (AtoM)** is a "web-based, open source application for standards-based archival description and access in a multilingual, multi-repository environment" ([AtoM website](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/)). It was created and is maintained by [Artefactual Systems, Inc.](https://www.artefactual.com)

SFU Archives has used AtoM since 2014 as its primary platform for archival description and for public dissemination of digital access copies of holdings. The site is shared (as [SFU AtoM](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca)) with SFU Special Collections and Rare Books, a division of SFU Library. As of June 2025, SFU AtoM is running AtoM version 2.8.2, using a customized theme aligned with SFU branding. Plans are to upgrade the site to the most recent 2.9 version some time in 2025.
