**Homebrew** is an open-source package manager that simplifies installation, update, and removal of software on a Mac.

SFU Archives uses Homebrew to install various open-source utilities and their dependencies. Many of these are command-line tools not available through SFU's **Managed Software Centre** app.

**You must  log in to your computer under an administrator account in order to install Homebrew or use it to install other program.**
