## Description
Use to generate a representation of the directory structure of a transfer package. In the Archives' digital transfer workflow, the report generated by Tree is uploaded to the FileAnalysis utility to support accessioning, appraisal, and description.

## Installation
Install with `homebrew`.

```
$ brew install tree
```

**Notes**
- You will need administrator access to your computer to install the software.

## Usage
You can use Tree to capture the full transfer down to the file level or (more typical for the Archives' workflow) to get a higher level representation of the folder structure.

Run Tree in a Terminal window.

```
$ tree -d -o <<file_path_for_output_report>> <<target_folder>>
```

- `-d` = Get directories only.

- `-o` = File path for output report; include file extension (e.g. `~/Desktop/tree.txt`)

- `target_folder` = Folder to be analyzed; you can get the file path by dragging the folder into your Terminal window.

**Notes**
- If you want the full listing (including files), omit the `-d` flag.

- Use the `-L <<number>>` flag to specify the level of folders to include; e.g. `-L 1` would print only the top-level folders and files.
